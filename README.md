### Hi 🙋🏻

My name is Shou (he/him) and I am a frontend developer :) 

I come from a background in the culture industry. My key focal points included research design, program impact evaluation, data collection, qualitative/quantitative/mixed-method data analysis, and interdisciplinary collaboration. My background empowers me to grow and adopt to every new need and challenges.
