### Hi 🙋🏻
My name is Shou (he/him) and I am a Junior Frontend Develope based in Los Angeles who loves building engaging web interfaces. I am the type of developer who likes to think beyond the code, and focus on how the interfaces co-create divese experiences with the users. 

My background is rooted in the Museum and Social Science where I hold a Master's degree in Tourism, Society and Environment from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. I've always held an innate intrigue for how society and individuals engage with built spaces and I'm excited be pivoting my interests towards digital spaces!
